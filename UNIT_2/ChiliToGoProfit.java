 *
 * Instructions:
 * In the ChiliToGo program in Exercise 12, the costs to produce an adult meal
 * and a childâ€™s meal are $4.35 and $3.10, respectively. Adult meals are sold for $7.00
 * and children's meals are sold for $4.00. Modify the ChiliToGo program to
 * display the total profit for each type of meal as well as the grand total profit.
 *
 * An example of the program is shown below:
 * Enter number of adult meals ordered >> 10
 * Enter number of child meals ordered >> 5
 * 10 adult meals were ordered at 7.0 each.
 *       Total is 70.0
 * 5 child meals were ordered at 4.0 each.
 *       Total is 20.0
 * Grand total for all meals is 90.0
 * Profits:
 *       Adult profit is 26.5
 *       Child profit is 4.5
 * Total profit is 31.0
