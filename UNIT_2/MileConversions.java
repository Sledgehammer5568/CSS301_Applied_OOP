 * // this is the original code provided
 * class MileConversions {
 *     public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         // Write your code here
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Requirements:
 * Write a program that declares constants to
 * represent the number of inches, feet, and
 * yards in a mile. Name the constants
 * INCHES_IN_MILE, FEET_IN_MILE, and
 * YARDS_IN_MILE respectively. Also declare a
 * variable named miles to represent a number
 * of miles. Compute and display, with
 * explanatory text, the value in inches, feet, and
 * yardsâ€”for example: 4.0 miles is 253440.0
 * inches, or 21120.0 feet, or 7040.0 yards
 *
 * Conversions:
 * There are 63,360 inches in a mile, 5,280 feet in
 * a mile, and 1,760 yards in a mile.
