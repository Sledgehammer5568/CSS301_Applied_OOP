 * Instructions:
 * Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local
 * customers. It charges $3.25 for a dozen eggs, or 45 cents for
 * individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. Write a program that
 * prompts a user for the number of eggs in the order and then
 * display the amount owed with a full explanation using the following wording:
 * You ordered 27 eggs. Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85.
