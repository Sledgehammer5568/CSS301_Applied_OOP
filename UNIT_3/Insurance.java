 * class Insurance {
 *     public static void main (String args[]) {
 *         // Write your code here
 *     }
 *
 *     public static int calculatePremium(int curr, int birth) {

 * }
 *
 * Instructions:
 * The Harrison Group Life Insurance company computes annual policy
 * premiums based on the age the customer turns in the current
 * calendar year. The premium is computed by taking the decade of the
 * customerâ€™s age, adding 15 to it, and multiplying by 20.
 *
 * For example, a 34-year-old would pay $360, which is calculated by
 * adding the decades (3) to 15, and then multiplying by 20.
 *
 * Write an application that prompts a user for the current year then a
 * birth year. Pass both to a method that calculates and returns the
 * premium amount, and then display the returned amount.
 *
 * An example of the program is shown below:
 * Enter the current year >> 2020
 * Enter the birth year >> 2001
 * The premium is $320
