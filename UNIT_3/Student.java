 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Create a class named Student that has fields for an ID number (idNumber),
 *   number of credit hours earned (hours), and number of points earned (points).
 *   (For example, many schools compute grade point averages based on a scale of 4,
 *   so a three-credit-hour class in which a student earns an A is worth 12 points.)
 *   Include get and set methods for all fields. A Student also has a field for grade
 *   point average. Include a getGradePoint() method to compute the grade point
 *   average field by dividing points by credit hours earned. Write methods to display
 *   the values in each Student field, showIdNumber(), showHours(), etc.
 *
 * -  Use class named ShowStudent that instantiates a Student object to test your
 *    class. Compute the Student grade point average, and then display all the values
 *    associated with the Student.
 *
 * -  Create a constructor for the Student class you created. The constructor should
 *    initialize each Studentâ€™s ID number to 9999, his or her points earned to 12, and
 *    credit hours to 3 (resulting in a grade point average of 4.0). Write a program that
 *    demonstrates that the constructor works by instantiating an object and displaying
 *    the initial values.
 *
 * An example of the program is shown below:
 * ID Number is: 234
 * Points Earned: 47
 * Credit Hours: 15
 * The grade point average is 3.1333333333333333
